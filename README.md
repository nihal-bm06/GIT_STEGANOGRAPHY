# Git Stegano Challenge 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to the **Git Steganography Challenge**!  
This repository contains hidden secrets distributed across branches, commits, and files. Can you uncover them all?

---

## Part A – Email Steg
- Hint: Not all “emails” are visible at first glance.  
- Hint: Think about **what changed in the repository**, not just the content of files.  
- Hint: Merge history might hide something subtle; sometimes merges speak louder than commits.  

## Part B – Time Steg
- Hint: Some secrets are hidden in the **timestamps of commits**.  
- Hint: Order matters, but you’ll need to **convert something numeric into letters**.  
- Hint: Base values or references might be implicit; don’t expect them to be spelled out.  

## Part C – Whitespace Steg
- Hint: Look where your eyes think there’s nothing.  
- Hint: Spaces and tabs can be **more meaningful than letters**.  
- Hint: Even empty-looking files can carry a sequence if interpreted cleverly.
